*__Warning!__* You won't find this repo to be very exciting! 

I'm using this repo to house the files and exercises for an online course I am taking from Coursera. The series of individual courses, is a specialization called [Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) and is presented by Dr. Charles Severance (i.e., Dr. Chuck) from the University of Michigan. 

This is an excellent introduction to programming in Python! The courses strike a nice balance between the lighthearted and the serious, and the exercises allow students to learn how to use Python in bite-sized chunks. I'd strongly recommend this series of courses to anybody that's interested in learning to code. 

I figure that it's also a good idea to get baked into the process of using git/github at the same time, so that it's a habit I learn from the outset; hence the repo.
