# this program revises the one from Chapter9 ex4.py. “Read and parse the “From” lines and pull out the addresses from the line. Count the number of messages from each person using a dictionary. After all the data has been read, print the person with the most commits by creating a list of (count, email) tuples from the dictionary. Then sort the list in reverse order and print out the person who has the most commits.”
